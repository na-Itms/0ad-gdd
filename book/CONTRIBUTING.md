Contributing
============

Contributing to the Design Document is possible for everyone, and is in many
ways similar to contributing to the game. We want the contributions to be
easy to perform and easy to review. In the future, we will look for a person
able to manage the evolution of this document, and the quality of contributions
and interactions with the reviewers will be a decisive factor in the choice
of the person.

Contributing is done by submitting a pull request to the DD repository.
NB: Update this part when this becomes official, in order to use the correct
vocabulary for the Phabricator workflow etc.

Small contributions, for fixing typos or style, will be accepted. Copy-pasting
from a former version of the document or from other sources (see
[Links and References](LINKS.md)) will be accepted if a link to the source is
provided in the commit message.

Bigger contributions, like proposals of a new feature, will be reviewed if
they come with a proof-of-concept that allows us to test the proposal. It can
be a patch, a mod, an edited image, etc. The proof-of-concept does not need
to be committable to the game source repository, it only needs to display
accurately the feature proposal. Please be aware that those contributions will
be more difficult to review and might need lengthy discussions and refinements.
