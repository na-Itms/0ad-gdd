0 A.D. - The Vision
===================

THE VISION OF 0 A.D.
--------------------

### Our Creed

0 A.D. is a historical (historically based) real time (non stop action)
strategy (decisions affect the outcome, not chance) game (fun and
enjoyable). I believe we say it best with the 0 A.D. creed:

*It is a moment in time that never was.* *It is the spring of the world,
and the dawn of history.* *It is a glimpse into an era when the empires
of the world are at their zenith.* *It is but a breath of an age when
mighty rulers wield rods of iron and brazen swords;* *to demonstrate
that they are indeed the greatest ancient civilisation!*

Let's break this creed down piece by piece.

**It is a moment in time that never was.**

It is important to note that "0 A.D." is a period in time that
historically never actually existed. Historians go directly from 1 B.C.
to 1 A.D. and skip over “0 A.D.” So, what are we saying? We are
specifying that this time period is a fictional time period.

**It is the spring of the world, and the dawn of history.**

History is defined as an account of a chronological chain of events.
People started recording history during the time period of our game. It
is this history that has been passed down to us, two millennia later.
The western world as we know it was birthed during this time.

The Roman historian Tacitus (55 - 120 A.D.) stated: “The principle
office of history I take to be this: To prevent virtuous actions from
being forgotten...”

This game reflects on the heroes that lived and conquered during the
timeframe of our game. It tells their stories in a fun and entertaining
way.

**It is a glimpse into an era when the empires of the world are at their
zenith.**

0 A.D. is a slice in time. Imagine if all the ancient worlds (at the
peak of their civilisations) were pitted one against another. We are
plucking major civilisations out of their linear timeframe and placing
them in the slice of time, which is 0 A.D.

**It is but a breath of an age when mighty rulers wield rods of iron and
brazen swords;**

Combat in the game plays the major role. Economic and political roles
take a back seat to strategic warfare. Are we glorifying war for
entertainment purposes? Uh… Yep.

**to demonstrate that they are indeed the greatest ancient
civilisation!**

Out of the 12 civilisations, which is the best? Well, we don't know!
That decision is put in the hands of the player. It is up to them to
either recreate or rewrite history.

### 2000 YEARS AGO

The game will draw people back 2000 years. This could be a bit difficult
because nobody really knows for sure how things were exactly. Much
information was lost during the dark ages. We are therefore basing most
everything on what our historians have been able to dig up for us. We
are taking a great effort to avoid stereotypical imagery and notions, in
an effort to give our players a realistic world.

As far as the look goes, our world will be a heightened representation
of reality. Colours will be a bit more saturated, vegetation will be
slightly edenic, structures will appear in a liveable state, units will
be battle-torn, and the resources will be bountiful. We will try to make
it as pleasing to the eye as possible.

Sound will be critical. It will draw the player into the world to give
the perception that they are actually there. Music will be epic, voices
will hearken back to an ancient time, sound effects will bring the
action to your home.

This game will make you (as a player) feel like you are in command of a
civilisation. You make the decisions that will lead to their ultimate
rise or demise.

### Heart and Soul of 0 A.D.

If you strip down the project to its very basic core we are left with a
'game'. It all boils down to a competitive activity, with a set of rules
in which players are engaged in a challenge that provides entertainment
and amusement. Players will also be rewarded by successfully surpassing
the challenges set before them.

Competition can occur on two basic levels: Player vs. Player and Player
vs. Computer. The Player vs. Player aspect will make it very important
for the game to have a set of identities (civilisations) that are both
balanced and unique. This will provide a multiplayer experience. Player
vs. Computer will require us to have a deep and strategic understanding
of our own game in order to provide a sufficient level of difficulty for
the AI to simulate the actions and reactions of a human player. This
will provide a single player experience.

The rules of the game are intended to offer players a wide variety of
choices to make. The more choices we allow, the greater the depth of
strategy we can offer. It is important that the variety of choices is
vast enough to allow the player to choose from an array of actions -
each having a unique set of repercussions. The rules of the game will
also have a historical basis that will establish it as the historical
RTS that it is.

Combat will be the focus of the competition. Economic and diplomatic
actions will be used to forward militaristic actions. Every entity in
the game will have a specific purpose and use. Much like in the game of
chess, each piece on the board has a specific role in a game. Also like
chess, a player who 'thinks ahead' and can 'set up' an opponent will
benefit from such actions.

This interactive/real-time contest should challenge the mind and avoid
boring repetitive actions. Hopefully the player will view the following
actions as fun:

-   A triumphant assault
-   Successfully repelling an attack
-   Creation of your base
-   Setting up your economy
-   Outwitting an opponent by using the correct tool for the job
-   Advancing your civilisation
-   A come-from-behind victory
-   Proper use of formation in a battle
-   Effective raiding
-   Acquiring territory
-   Recreation of history
-   Reversing history's outcome
-   Advancing a unit to a higher level of rank
-   Creating scenarios for others to play
-   Allying with another human player against a common enemy

When a player is given an obstacle to overcome and they accomplish their
goal, they should be rewarded. It will be the reward that encourages
them to continue playing. The more they play, the more parts of the game
they will 'unlock'.

### A Responsibility

Because we are in a unique position of engaging the minds of young
adults, I believe it is our responsibility to portray the game world as
true to history as possible. There are going to be many
names/places/events that many people are not familiar with from the
general education they receive at their schools.

Games in the past have been known to give faulty information that
misleads people. I believe this is wrong. We have a duty to properly
present the history of our game to our audience. Hopefully this will
encourage and supplement their education.

As the philosopher George Santayana said, “Those who cannot remember the
past are condemned to repeat it.”

### Snares

It is very easy for a game to fall prey to many of the common mistakes
that prove disastrous to the games in the RTS genre. We need to keep our
guard up and avoid these pitfalls:

-   **Fastest click wins** - In many RTS games, it isn't the player with
    the most intelligence or the best strategy that wins, it's the
    player who A\] knows the proper order of actions and carries them
    out the fastest. People that practice a general procedure that is
    usually rewarding and know keyboard shortcuts should be slightly
    advantaged, and they will still be required; but, the if the
    opponent recognises their 'cookie cutter' gameplay, they should
    easily be able to outwit them by identifying and countering the
    unoriginal/over-used tactics with an effective counteractive
    strategy.
-   **Single path to victory** - It seems to be a trend that games cater
    to a specific strategy that is frequently used to attain a victory.
    That could be rushing, turtling, booming, etc. We recognise these
    are valid ways to win a game, but we will attempt to not favour one
    over another. Players should be able to successfully use (and
    adapt/change) any strategy to achieve a victory.
-   **Sneaky Tricks** - Many games overlook some aspects of gameplay
    that are unintentionally (by the game designers) used to a player's
    advantage. Through many hours of gameplay testing, we need to
    identify and eliminate these tricks.
-   **Frustration of Artificial Intelligence** - It is important to
    minimise frustration when playing the game. I have lost count of the
    times I've screamed at the computer, “WHY DID \_\_\_\_ DO \_\_\_\_!”
    Whether its AI pathfinding or suicidal units, we need to minimise
    player frustration by rigorous AI testing.
-   **Confusing UI** - It is very important to avoid handicapping
    gameplay by making the user interface so complicated that people are
    not capable of doing what they want to do, and stop playing the game
    because they can't figure out how to control it. We to need promote
    an interface that can be easily picked up by our target audience. It
    is critical to pay special attention to other games in our genre
    from which we will be drawing players.
-   **Repetition** - If you find yourself doing the same action over and
    over without thought, then we need to either eliminate or automate
    such an action. Linear repetitious procedures are meaningless and
    boring.
-   **Overly Ambitious** - I think it is very important for us to always
    remember that this is the first project we have ever done. Much of
    the knowledge we have gained is based on trial and error. We will
    probably continue to forge forward in this fashion. We need to
    understand our limits and avoid getting fixed on them. We should aim
    high, but not so high that our goals are unattainable.

### Why?

What is in it for me? Why would someone play our game over another game?
I think the largest factor in answering that question would be that the
game is FREE. Perhaps not the best reason why people will play our game,
but it should not be discredited.

I would love to have people say that the game had stunning graphics, a
gripping storyline, and left players with a thirst for the game that
could not be quenched, but that probably won't happen. As a realist I
have come to grips with the fact that we are not able to compete with
the professional game studios.

We can however do our best to include some features that will set us
apart from the crowd and make 0 A.D. unique:

-   **Accurate History** - All our content is validated by our History
    Department to ensure that it is true to source wherever possible
    (unless it negatively affects gameplay).
-   **Citizen Soldiers** - There will be no standard villager unit.
    Instead, regular infantry and cavalry have not only military
    capabilities, but also economic, making them substantially more
    versatile than in typical RTS games.
-   **Unit Auto Upgrading** - Citizen Soldiers will gain experience and
    automatically gain promotions. With each rank, they become stronger,
    and don a unique appearance.
-   **Units on Structures** - Some garrisoned units will be visible on
    the battlements of structures or the decks of ships, and capable of
    firing on opponents at range.
-   **Realistic Ships** - Ship gameplay will include a variety of new
    features, from a much larger scale, to ship capture, to sea rams, to
    a modular design that allows catapults to be stationed on the decks,
    and units to fire from the bows.
-   **Excellent Moddability** - Our aim is to make the game as
    data-driven as possible, and allow end-users to override that data,
    using custom independent mod packs, to have as much control over
    adding assets and editing existing content as our own scriptors.
    Savvy modders could potentially have all the necessary tools to
    program an entirely different game using our engine.
-   **More Multiplayer modes** - The host will have a wide variety of
    game types and features to tweak when creating a game session,
    permitting the kind of gameplay that he most enjoys.
-   **Provinces and Territories** - In some game types, the map is
    subdivided into Provinces that must be captured and annexed into a
    player's territory in order to reap their valuable resources and
    construct forward bases in these areas. If the host wishes, a
    player's starting Territory can also be surrounded by attrition
    borders to reduce early rushes.
-   **Real World Map Realism** - Random Maps based upon geographical
    regions where the civilisations of the ancient world lived and
    'died'. These will be generated with biome specific-to-location
    features that replicate (as best we have researched) the look and
    feel of the world as it existed 2,000 years ago. This provides for
    further player immersion into the game.

### RTS Genre

You're probably thinking, "Why is someone creating another RTS game?"
Since we converted the 0 A.D. project from an Age of Kings modification
project to a complete stand-alone game, we have grappled with this same
question. If it is just another clone, what is the point? Hasn't the RTS
genre reached its pinnacle? Isn't it time to move on?

We are well aware of the issue of setting our project apart from being
just 'another RTS clone' and are doing our best to define ourselves.

The genre itself is moving in a different direction since its
redefinition a few years ago with the newly discovered capabilities of
3D. Some have headed towards RPG (Role playing games), some towards FPS
(First person shooter), and some towards TBS (Turn based strategy), and
others towards RTT (Real time tactical).

Developers do not seem to be content to further the traditional RTS in
the same vein as Age of Empires, Command and Conquer, Red Alert, and
Warcraft II. Though some are fleeing, we are going to stake a claim in
the RTS genre. There is still much innovation to be made. This for us
means:

1.  Less tedious/mindless micro-management
2.  More strategic thinking
3.  Greater stress on planning, formations, and tactics
4.  Choices, Choices, and more Choices
5.  Enhancing the multiplayer experience

Innovation (nowadays) is not “amazing 3D graphics” or “hundreds of
units”. Those are now merely the standard by which an RTS is measured; a
rite of passage. If that is all we can hope to attain, then it won't do
us any good that the game is free; we would probably have to pay people
to play it.

So we set out to create our own game… It is a large task, but I am
confident that our team is up to it. Are we worried that the game will
not be original enough? Yes, we are. But, we are doing our best to
ensure that it will be a product worthy of being called a 'game' and not
just a clone.

### A Comparison

If you were to compare our game to other games, how would it stack up?
What would be familiar? Here is a rundown of commonalities with other
games.

-   Age of Empires - Historical era
-   Age of Kings - Basic combat system
-   Rise of Nations - Territories
-   Generals - Ranks
-   Warcraft III - Heroes
-   Praetorians - Units in trees
-   Knights of Honor - Units on structures
-   Civilization - Technology 'tree'

### Our Audience

The players we are targeting will likely have one of the following
traits:

-   An interest in our time period and/or civilisations
-   Ancient warfare
-   “Age of” gamers
-   RTS buffs
-   Map Makers
-   Mod Makers
-   Single Player campaign players
-   Online Multiplayers
-   LAN Partiers

### WFG Team

The Wildfire Games team is an assembly of individuals with a large
variance of location, experience, skills, and personalities. Together,
as a team, we have united to partake in an experience that very few have
successfully completed.

There are many obstacles we must overcome if this game is to be
completed:

-   **Virtual** - We are a virtual team with no central office. All our
    communication is done via the internet.
-   **Hobbyist** - None of us are doing this as a fully time job. We are
    not paid. This project comes secondary to work, school, and family.
-   **Inexperience** - Very few of us have done this for a living. There
    are so many things we have to learn by trial and error.
-   **Expansive** - RTS games are complex. The sheer volume of art,
    music, scripts, and code that needs to be created is a huge task,
    even for a professional development studio.
-   **Reward** - The payoff for developing this game is not a salary.
    Many prospective staff members are turned off by the fact that we
    cannot offer monetary compensation.

For our team, it will be an uphill battle. Though it will be difficult I
am sure our team can rise to the challenge. Talent attracts talent, and
we certainly have a lot of it. If we continue to surround ourselves with
the best and the brightest we will surely maintain our potential for
quality and excellence.
