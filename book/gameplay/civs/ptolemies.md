### MERCENARY CAMP UNITS

* **Generic Name: Mercenary Thureos Spearman.**
* **Specific Name: Thureophóros Misthophóros.**
  * **Melee Class:** Spearman.
  * **Ranged Class:** Skirmisher.
  * **Melee Armament:** Spear or "Dory."
  * **Ranged Armament:** Javelin. 
  * **Appearance:** All levels carry the famous "thureos" celtic-style oval shield, although the center boss is an oval shape, rather than butterfly as in Celtic examples.

    * **Elite:** Plumed and crested Thracian-style Hellenistic helmets. Tunic with white stripe down the center. White boots. Decorative sheathed xiphos.
  * **History:** The thureophoroi (singular: thureophoros) was a type of infantry soldier, common in the 3rd to 1st century BCE, who carried a large oval shield called a thureos which had a type of metal strip boss and a central spine. They were armed with a long thrusting spear, javelins and a sword. They also usually wore an iron or bronze Macedonian helmet. The thureos was probably originally an adapted form of a Celtic shield. Thracian and Illyrian infantry probably adopted the shield before the Greeks. However it has been suggested that the thureos was brought to Greece after Pyrrhus of Epirus' campaigns in Italy, as his Oscan allies and Roman enemies used the scutum. Thureophoroi were a 3rd century development on the Peltast and wore no body armor, but did wear sturdy leather boots for quick movement. Thureophoroi could skirmish, as well as fight in a phalanx when necessary. They were often stationed on the flanks of the traditional pike phalanx as a flexible link between the heavier pikemen and the cavalry wings.

Later, such armament and tactics were picked up by Successor light cavalry, carrying the large round shield while hurling clutches of javelins into the enemy ranks at long or short range. The name "Tarantine" remained and was used by bands of Greek and Successor mercenary cavalrymen well into the Hellenistic era.

### SUPPORT UNITS

* **Generic Name: Egyptian Woman.**
* **Specific Name: .**
  * **Class:** Female Citizen.
  * **Appearance:** Dark skin, like the Mauryan Woman.
  * **History:** Egyptian women of ancient times had legal and economic rights in parity with Egyptian men. They could own slaves and property and when wed to their husband they did not automatically become his property as was the case in many other ancient and modern cultures. It is interesting to note that when the Greco-Macedonians conquered Egypt in the 4th century B.C., Egyptian women continued to retain their liberal economic and legal rights while Greek women who also lived in Egypt were subject to the rule of traditional Greek law.
  * **Garrison:** 1.

  * **Special:** Garrison a Trader inside to boost the amount of trade received.

* **Generic Name: Bireme.**
* **Specific Name: Biḗrēs.**
  * **Class:** Light Warship.
  * **Appearance:**
    * **Shell:** 2 tiers of oars.
  * **History:** The design of the bireme was modified from the penteconter, a ship that had only one set of oars on each side, the bireme having two sets of oars on each side.
  * **Garrison:** Cannot.
  * **Function:** These ships were designed to go fast so they could transport troops to the sites of battles.
  * **Special:** -

* **Generic Name: Trireme.**
* **Specific Name: Triḗrēs.**
  * **Class:** Medium Warship.
  * **Appearence:**
    * **Shell:** Three tiers of oars. Larger than the Bireme.
  * **History:** The first Triremes were built circa 650BC, and by 500BC the Trireme was the most widely used heavy warship of the Greek city-states. In the Trireme the outriggers were now an integral part of the ship's hull. The Trireme also had a partial or full fighting deck above the rowers. The length of the Trireme remained approximately 35-38 meters, and the beam was approximately 3.5 metres. A Trireme carried 170 oarsmen, plus twenty sailors and fourteen marines in Greek navies. The top speed of a Trireme was approximately 11.5 knots. Some Triremes may have been able to reach higher speeds in short bursts. A Trireme travelling from Athens to Mitylene in 427BC made the 350 kilometre trip in only 24 hours, averaging eight knots (14.6 km/h). The Trireme could accelerate much faster than a Bireme or Penteconter, and was much more manoeuvrable. This gave the Trireme an advantage in combat, where higher speed and manoeuvrability meant a better chance of victory.
  * **Garrison:** Cannot.
  * '''Function: '''The common tactics of the time were to ram one's opponent. Most ships at the time were equipped with a large battering ram at the bow which was used to crush the sides of an opponent. Another common tactic was to brush along the sides of the opponent's ship and snap all of the oars off. Once the ship was disabled and floundering in the waves, then the other ship could move in and finish its opponent. The Greeks employed the ramming tactics to excellent effect throughout out their naval battles. Speed was the key element for ramming and that required maneuverability and lightly armoured ships.
  * **Special:** Ramming.

* **Generic Name: Quinquereme.**
* **Specific Name: Pentḗrēs.**
  * **Class:** Heavy Warship.

### SIEGE UNITS

* **Generic Name: Siege Tower**
* **Specific Name: Helepolis**
  * '''Class: '''Siege Tower.
  * **Appearance:**
    * **Shell:** Siege Tower
  * **History:** When Demetrius Poliorcetes besieged Salamis, in Cyprus, he instructed that a machine be constructed, which he called "the taker of cities." Its form was that of a square tower, each side 90 cubits high and 45 wide. It rested on four wheels, each eight cubits high. It was divided into nine stories, the lower of which contained machines for throwing great stones, the middle large catapults for throwing spears, and the highest, other machines for throwing smaller stones, together with smaller catapults. It was manned with 200 soldiers, besides those that moved it by pushing the parallel beams at the bottom (Diod. xx.48).
  * **Garrison:** 5. <== Note largest garrison requirement you're likely to find.
  * **Function:** Functions much like a warship, but on land. Is able to garrison all types of units (except cavalry) to increase attack and other attributes, including other siege units. This in all probability could/should be a campaign and editor-only unit. However, once we implement walls and ships as spec'd, we'll have a better understanding of whether or not we can include the Helepolis in the standard game.
  * '''Special: '''May unload garrisoned units over enemy walls.

* **Generic Name: Stone Thrower**
* **Specific Name: Lithobolos**
  * **Class:** Stone Thrower
  * **Appearance:**
    * **Shell:** Stone-throwing catapult, similar to the Roman onager.
  * '''History: '''The Lithobolos (Stone Thrower) hurled stones of 10 lbs (4.5 kilos) to 180 lbs (82 kilos) in weight. They all looked alike and differed only in size: the dimensions being calculated by a complex mathematical formula based on the spring diameter. Such machines were normally brought to point-blank range (150-200 yards [157m - 185m]) and were capable of stripping the battlements from fortified walls.
  * **Garrison:** 3.
  * **Function:** Anti-building siege. Used to take down Walls and Fortresses. 10-20% weaker than the Roman Ballista.
  * '''Special: '''Does bonus damage vs. enemy units garrisoned atop walls and towers.

  * **Hacker Armament (Passive-Trample):** Feet.
  * **Appearance:** North African War Elephant with tower on its back.
  * **History:** The North African elephant was trained for war and used by the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. Writing in the 2nd century BC, Polybius (The Histories; 5.83) described their inferiority in battle against the larger Indian elephants used by the Seleucid kings. A surviving Ptolemaic inscription enumerates three types of war elephant, the "Troglodytic" (probably Libyan), the "Ethiopian", and the "Indian". The Ptolemaic king prides himself with being the first to tame the Ethiopian elephants, a stock which could be identical to one of the two extant African species. (source: Wikipedia)

  * **History:** The age of the Successors ('Diadokhoi') was the age of the arms race. Ever larger and more complex machines of war were envisioned and constructed. Among those machines was the gigantic juggernauts of the Ptolemaic navy, or 'Poliremes'. Some of these ships were large enough to boast crews of over a thousand strong or more. These were more like floating fortresses than tactical naval ships. With the end of the Hellenistic states in the 1st century BC came the end of these mighty juggernauts.
  * **Garrison:** Cannot.
  * '''Function: '''Floating fortress and transport barge.
  * **Special:**
    * Build limit: 1 (raised to 5 during the lifetime of Ptolemy IV Philopater).

### PTOLEMAIC HEROES

* **Generic Name: Ptolemy I "Savior".**
* **Specific Name: Ptolemaios A' Soter.**
  * **Class:** Hero1.
  * **Hacker Armament:** .
  * **Ranged Armament:** None.
  * **Appearance:**
    * **Body:** Similar to that of a Macedonian Silver Shield, but with a cape. Boots.
    * **Helmet:** Crested Attic helmet, highly embossed..
    * **Shield:** Round shield with Macedonian insignia.
    * **Figure(s):** .
    * **Mount:** Similar to the Towered War Elephant.
  * **History:** Born in 367 BCE, Ptolemy I grew to become one of Alexander the Great's closest friends and generals. He was instrumental in Alexander's later campaigns in Bactria (modern Afghanistan) and India. After Alexander's death, Ptolemy took control of the Satrap of Egypt, and after the Battle of Ipsus became sole ruler of Egypt as "Pharaoh," founding the Ptolemy Dynasty that would rule Egypt for nearly 3 centuries. Ptolemaic Egypt reached the height of its territorial boundaries under his reign as he added Syria, Judea, Cyprus, and parts of Asia Minor to his realm. His reputation for bonhomie and liberality attached the floating soldier-class of Macedonians and Hellenes to his service, and was not insignificant; nor did he wholly neglect conciliation of the native Egyptians. He was a ready patron of letters, founding the Great Library of Alexandria. He himself wrote a history of Alexander's campaigns that has not survived. This used to be considered an objective work, distinguished by its straightforward honesty and sobriety. However, Ptolemy may have exaggerated his own role, and had propagandist aims in writing his History. Although now lost, it was a principal source for the surviving account by Arrian of Nicomedia. Ptolemy died in 283 BCE, the last of the Diodachoi, leaving a well-ordered and stable kingdom to his progeny.
  * **Garrison:** 3.

    * **Shield:** Cavalry shield with Ptolemaic insignia.
    * **Figure(s):** .
    * **Mount:** Similar to the King's Guard Cavalry, except more elaborate.
  * **History:** Ptolemy IV Philopater's reign was inaugurated by the murder of his mother, and he was always under the dominion of favourites, male and female, who indulged his vices and conducted the government as they pleased. Self-interest led his ministers to make serious preparations to meet the attacks of Antiochus III the Great on Coele-Syria including Judea, and the great Egyptian victory of Raphia (217), where Ptolemy himself was present, secured the northern borders of the kingdom for the remainder of his reign. Ptolemy IV is said to have built a giant ship known as the tessarakonteres ("forty"), a huge type of galley. The forty of its name may refer to its number of banks of oars. The current theory is that Ptolemy's ship was an oversize catamaran galley, measuring 128 m 420 ft.
  * **Garrison:** 2.
  * **Function:** Naval enhancement. He has low armour.

    * "Hero" Bonus (Juggernaut train limit raised to 5 during his lifetime.)

    * **Figure(s):** .
  * **History:** Cleopatra VII is one of the most discussed women in history. She came to the throne of Egypt at the age of 18 and ruled with guile and cunning. Fully Greek in heritage, she nevertheless engendered great support from the Egyptian people by being the first Ptolemaic Pharaoh to learn the Egyptian language. Her patron goddess was the Egyptian goddess Issus, even though by this time the Macedonians had imported much of their pantheon of Olympian gods. Cleopatra met Julius Caesar in 48 BCE, when he arrived to conquer Egypt for Rome. She succeeded in changing his mind. She bore him a son the next year and traveled to Rome as Caesar's bride, but when Julius was assassinated she fled back to Egypt. Later, on his way to attack Parthia, Marcus Antony, trusted general of the late Caesar, stopped in Egypt. There he met Cleopatra and fell immediately in love. Cleopatra bore him 4 children. Together, they fought Octavian Caesar (who would go on to become Augustus Caesar, first emperor of Rome) in a Roman civil war. After the disastrous naval battle of Actium (31 BCE) off the coast of Greece, they fled back to Egypt, hotly pursued by Octavian. The next year, surrounded by Octavian's forces with no hope of regaining power, Antony committed suicide. Cleopatra, the last of the Egyptian Pharaohs and the last of Alexander's Successors, followed Antony in death, committing suicide by Asp, a deadly snake.

### NEW UNIT TRAITS

* Syntagma Formation: A Macedonian-style formation that makes pikemen nearly invulnerable from the front.

* "Stench" Aura: Enemy cavalry units are spooked by elephants and camels, and prove less effective when in range of them.
* "Trample Damage" Aura: As with war elephants and melee cavalry of all types, causes passive crush damage to nearby enemy units through trampling.

### CIV CENTRE UNITS

* Melee Infantry: Egyptian Pikeman.
* Ranged Infantry: Nubian Archer.
* Cavalry: Nabataean Camel Rider.

### FORBIDDEN CLASSES

### SPECIAL STRUCTURES

* **Generic Name: Mercenary Camp.**
* **Specific Name: Stratópedo Misthophóron.**
  * **Class:** SB1.
  * **History:** The Greco-Macedonian Ptolemy Dynasty relied on large numbers of Greek and foreign mercenaries for the bulk of its military force, mainly because the loyalty of native Egyptian units was often suspect. Indeed, during one native uprising, Upper Egypt was lost to the Ptolemies for decades. Mercenaries were often battle-hardened and their loyalty can be bought, sometimes cheaply, sometimes not cheaply. This was of no matter, since Egypt under the Ptolemies was so prosperous as to be the richest of Alexander's successor states.

CIV BONUSES
-----------

* **CB1**
  * **Generic Name: Mercenary Army.**
  * **Specific Name: .**
  * **History:** The Greco-Macedonian Ptolemy Dynasty relied on large numbers of Greek and foreign mercenaries for the bulk of its military force, mainly because the loyalty of native Egyptian units was often suspect. Indeed, during one native uprising, Upper Egypt was lost to the Ptolemies for decades. Mercenaries were often battle-hardened and their loyalty can be bought, sometimes cheaply, sometimes not cheaply. This was of no matter, since Egypt under the Ptolemies was so prosperous as to be the richest of Alexander's successor states.
  * **Effect:** The Ptolemies receive the "Stratópedo Misthophóron" special building (or "Mercenary Camp"), which is essentially a barracks that is constructed in neutral territory and trains all mercenary soldiers.

* **ST4 (Extra Farming Tech 2)**
  * **Generic Name: Water Wheel.**
  * **Specific Name: Sāqīya.**
  * **History:** A water wheel used to disburse water from lower elevations into irrigation canals. The earliest evidence of a sakia is from a Hellenistic tomb painting in Ptolemaic Egypt which dates to the 2nd century BC. It shows a pair of yoked oxen driving a compartmented waterwheel, which is for the first time depicted, too. The Greek sakia gear system is already shown fully developed to the point that modern Egyptian devices are virtually identical. It is assumed that the scientists of the Museum of Alexandria, at the time the most active Greek research center, may have been involved in its invention. An episode from the Alexandrian War in 48 BC tells of how Caesar's enemies employed geared waterwheels to pour sea water from elevated places onto the position of the trapped Romans.
