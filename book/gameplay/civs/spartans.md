  * **History:** Spartan women were some of the freest in the ancient world. They could own land and slaves and even exercise naked like Spartan men. It is said that only Spartan women gave birth to real men. Such tough as nails women more than once helped save their city from disaster, for example when after a lost battle against Pyrrhus of Epirus they overnight built an earthen rampart to protect the city while their men slept in preparation for the next day's siege.
  * **Garrison:** 1.

  * **Function:** -
  * **Special:** -

### NAVY

* **Generic Name: Fishing Boat.**
* **Specific Name: Ploion Halieutikon.**
  * **Class:** Fishing Ship.
  * **Appearance:**
    * **Shell:** -
  * **History:** In contrast to hunting, fishing was not held in high regard and Hellenic artwork is nearly devoid of fishing scenes. Nonetheless fishing was popular both as the poor man’s entertainment and as a viable alternative to farming as a major food source.

* **Generic Name: Penteconter.**
* **Specific Name: Pentēkónteros.**
  * **Class:** Light Warship.
  * '''Appearance: '''
    * **Shell:** Single-tier, 25 rows.
  * **History:** Penteconters were employed from 800 BC, mostly as a light support unit in the Spartan navy. After 600 BC, they were only seen in battle in very limited numbers. They were still in use by small states which could not afford a sufficient number of triremes for their navy.
  * **Garrison:** Cannot.
  * **Function:** These ships were designed to go fast so they could transport troops to the sights of battles. They had a single tier (level) of 25 oarsmen on each side, and were called Penteconters.
  * **Special:** -

* **Generic Name: Trireme.**
* **Specific Name: Triḗrēs.**
  * **Class:** Medium Warship.
  * '''Appearence: '''
    * **Shell:** Three tiers of oars. Larger than the Penteconter.
  * **History:** The first Triremes were built circa 650BC, and by 500BC the Trireme was the most widely used heavy warship of the Greek city-states. In the Trireme the outriggers were now an integral part of the ship's hull. The Trireme also had a partial or full fighting deck above the rowers. The length of the Trireme remained approximately 35-38 meters, and the beam was approximately 3.5 metres. A Trireme carried 170 oarsmen, plus twenty sailors and fourteen marines in Greek navies. The top speed of a Trireme was approximately 11.5 knots. Some Triremes may have been able to reach higher speeds in short bursts. A Trireme travelling from Athens to Mitylene in 427BC made the 350 kilometre trip in only 24 hours, averaging eight knots (14.6 km/h). The Trireme could accelerate much faster than a Bireme or Penteconter, and was much more manoeuvrable. This gave the Trireme an advantage in combat, where higher speed and manoeuvrability meant a better chance of victory.
  * **Garrison:** Cannot.
  * '''Function: '''The common tactics of the time were to ram one's opponent. Most ships at the time were equipped with a large battering ram at the bow which was used to crush the sides of an opponent. Another common tactic was to brush along the sides of the opponent's ship and snap all of the oars off. Once the ship was disabled and floundering in the waves, then the other ship could move in and finish its opponent. The Greeks employed the ramming tactics to excellent effect throughout out their naval battles. Speed was the key element for ramming and that required maneuverability and lightly armoured ships.
  * **Special:** .

### SIEGE UNITS

* **Generic Name: Battering Ram.**

  * **Appearance:** Corinthian helmet with side-to-side large, bright red crest, bronze cuirass, bronze greaves, spear, aspis with Spartan regimental symbols, Xiphos sheathed on left side.
  * **History:** The Spartans had a very peculiar form of government which enabled them to be professional soldiers. It not only enabled them, but actually forced them to be superior soldiers as a small group of Spartans had to dominate an enormous number of subjects and unwilling allies. The Spartan army was superior in Hellas, and in the rest of the known world. No other army was so well trained, and had such excellent equipment. They believed that traditional training was the key to success, and for centuries they were correct, as they never lost a battle in spite of their small numbers. Ironically enough, this concept ended the Spartan supremacy, as the Spartan phalanx could not resist the new sloped Theban phalanx and the invading integrated Macedonian forces. The end of the Spartan power marked the end of the domination of the phalanx.
  * '''Garrison: '''1.
  * **Function:** Good vs. Cavalry and Infantry. Their Achilles Heel is definitely archery, with no extra pierce armor when compared to the standard "Greek Hoplite." Uses Xiphos (sword) when not in formation. Uses Dory (spear) when in formation.

He successfully blocked the way of the huge Persian army through the narrow passage with his 7000 men, until Xerxes was made aware of a secret unobstructed path. Finding the enemy at his rear, Leonidas sent home most of his troops, choosing to stay behind with 300 hand-picked hoplites and win time for the others to withdraw.

After securing Crete as a Spartan tributary, Agis then moved to besiege the city of Megopolis in the Peloponnese, who was an ally of Macedon. Antipater, the Macedonian regent, lead an army to stop this new uprising. In the Battle of Megalopolis, the Macedonians prevailed in a long and bloody battle. Much like Leonidas 150 years earlier, instead of surrendering, Agis made a heroic final stand in order to buy time for his troops to retreat.

----------------------

### VILLAGE

* **Generic Name: Household.**
* **Specific Name: Oikos.**

  * **History:** Spartan houses were known to be particularly simple because of two laws of Lycurgus. The first enforced that the roofs only be crafted with an axe, and the second made doors only constructed with saws as tools.

The Spartans were so feared for their discipline that the enemy army would sometimes break up and run away before a single shield clashed.

  * **Effect:** Allied team members can train Spartiates.

TECHNOLOGIES
------------

* **Infantry:** Good. Almost all technologies. Their heroes and champion infantry are very strong. Ranged units are the exception: neither here, nor there. Few ranged techs.
* **Cavalry:** Mediocre to poor. Nothing to match the cavalry of the Persians, for instance.
* **Naval:** Mediocre. Good ships, but few techs.
* **Siege:** Poor. Only the battering ram is available. Few siege techs. The Spartans were not known as good besiegers.

  * **Land Trade:** Mediocre. Definitely nothing to match that of the best civs in the area.
  * **Naval Trade:** Mediocre. Definitely nothing to match that of the best civs in the area.
  * **Architecture:** Above average. I would say something on the order of 80% of that of the Persians.

SPECIAL TECHNOLOGIES
--------------------

  * **Name: Feminine Mystique.**
  * **History:** Spartan women were some of the freest in the ancient world. They could own land and slaves and even exercise naked like Spartan men. It is said that only Spartan women gave birth to real men.

  * **Effect:** Spartan female citizens cannot be captured and will doggedly fight back against any attackers. They are also capable of constructing defense towers and palisades.

* **ST2**
  * **Name: Tyrtean Paeans.**
  * **History:** Paeans were battle hymns that were sung by the hoplites when they charged the enemy lines. One of the first known Paeans were composed by Tirteus, a warrior poet of Sparta, during the First Messenian War.
