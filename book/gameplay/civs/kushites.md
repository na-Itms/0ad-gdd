KUSHITE CIVILIZATION PROFILE
==============================

![Kushites Civ Center](kushites-header.png "Kushites Civ Center")

The Kingdom of Kush was an ancient African kingdom situated on the confluences of the Blue Nile,
White Nile and River Atbara in what is now the Republic of Sudan. The Kushite era of rule in the region
was established after the Bronze Age collapse of the New Kingdom of Egypt, and it was centered at
Napata in its early phase. They invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, and the Kushite emperors ruled as
Pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt for a century, until they were expelled by the Assyrians.
Kushite culture was influenced heavily by the Egyptians, with Kushite pyramid building and monumental
temple architecture still extent. The Kushites even worshipped many Egyptian gods, including Amun.
During Classical antiquity, the Kushite imperial capital was at Meroe. In early Greek geography, the
Meroitic kingdom was known as Aethiopia. The Kushite kingdom persisted until the 4th century AD,
when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion, eventually succumbing to the rising power
of Axum.

UNIT DESCRIPTIONS
-----------------

### INFANTRY
Archers formed the basic core of Nubian armies that challenged Egypt for control over parts of the Nile
valley, and then conquered Egypt in the 8th century BC, and confronted the troops of the Assyrian
empire. Nubia was the “Land of the Bow”. “Land of the Bow” from the meaning of Ta-Seti, an ancient
Egyptian term used to denote Nubia for thousands of years in antiquity. Nubian archers mostly used
one-piece bows ranging from six to seven feet long, with a powerful draw strength that many of the archers
used their feet to bend their bows. The bows were fabricated from seasoned palm wood, with the arrows
made of cane. Arrows were sometimes poisoned.

### CAVALRY

While the bulk of Kushite armies were the infantry archers, Nubia’s elite warriors of the time loosed their arrows from horseback and employed thumb rings to increase the force and accuracy of their shots.

### SUPPORT UNITS

In Nubia, a matrilineal society, women played a key role, almost unheard of in the ancient world. They participated in governance of the kingdom.  The innovation of female rulers represents something not seen in any other major civilization. This was opposed to Egypt, where a few women exercised power as an exception to the rule not as a norm. As a show of how important females were in this joint rule, one of the largest pyramids built for the rulers of Kush was for Queen Shanakdakheto (170-150 B.C.E.), a woman.

Research has discovered that 90% of the bones of ancient Kushites examined from skeletons from the 350 – 550 AD contain traces of the antibiotic tetracycline, including those of 24-month-old infants. Additionally all the bones that were examined were infection free. The Egyptians had a vast knowledge of the human body and were well known for their strong and effective medicines that were said to be to cure any affliction known to man at the time. Based on the research findings, it is likely that the healers of Kush had learned some of these practices.

The Kushites were known for their mining of minerals and high-quality stone for trade. The Kushites also introduced and developed iron metallurgy to the region.  Additionally, this region of Africa also produced more gold than anywhere in the world at that time. As middlemen, Kushite traders passed along ivory, ebony, incense, and other exotic goods from the South to the Egyptians who then traded with other Mediterranean peoples.  Kerma, strategically located on the Nile River, controlled the trade routes from the south of Kush to Egypt in the north.  This role as a trade middleman influenced the relationship between Egypt and Kush.

### NAVY

The proud ancient Black African civilization of Kush settled along the upper reaches of the Nile. Kush resided in the gold and iron center of the ancient world. It relied on trade as the main source of income and supply. It was also a major exporter of such rare sought after commodities spices and incense. The Kush merchant navy was a major presence and traded throughout the Mediterranean sea, even as far away as India. Information on the Kushite is very scare, but indications point to military vessels being very similar to Egyptian vessels.\

The first Triremes were built circa 650BC, and by 500BC the Trireme was the most widely used heavy warship. In the Trireme the outriggers were now an integral part of the ship's hull. The Trireme also had a partial or full fighting deck above the rowers. The length of the Trireme remained approximately 35-38 meters, and the beam was approximately meters, and the beam was 3.5 meters. The top speed of a Trireme was approximately 11.5 knots. The Trireme could accelerate much faster than a Bireme and was much more maneuverable. This gave the Trireme an advantage in combat, where higher speed and maneuverability meant a better chance of victory.

When Demetrius Poliorcetes besieged Salamis, in Cyprus, he instructed that a machine be constructed, which he called "the taker of cities." Its form was that of a square tower, each side 90 cubits high and 45 wide. It rested on four wheels, each eight cubits high. It was divided into nine stories, the lower of which contained machines for throwing great stones, the middle large catapults for throwing spears, and the highest, other machines for throwing smaller stones, together with smaller catapults. It was manned with 200 soldiers, besides those that moved it by pushing the parallel beams at the bottom (Diod. xx.48).

STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS
----------------------

The Kushite civilization begins with the Village phase consisting of three structures: Civic Center as the center of the civilization, a Corral to raise herd animals for food, and a Dock to construct Naval vessels and to open sea trade. As the village progresses in size and technological advances it will move into the Town phase and more diverse structures will become available. The ultimate progress will advance the Town into the City phase which will allow the city to build all structures available to the civilization, including specific civilization unique structures.

The game does not advance through Ages, but rather through three phases of growth; Village, Town, and City. In the interests of reducing art workload, building models are not replaced with upgraded versions when a player advances from one phase to another. Therefore only one set of structure models is needed per civilization.

![Kushites Civ Center](kushites/civic.png "Kushites Civ Center")

Provides housing for a moderate amount of people, and you can create a selection of Citizen Soldiers as well as Female Citizens here. You can garrison a moderate amount of people for their protection and to heal them here as well. Garrisoned soldiers increase the rate of fire of this building. Resource dropsite for all resources.

In the ancient world there were not only warriors who were professional soldiers and had fighting as their job, there were also Citizen Soldiers who most of the time worked with something else (typically farming) and only sometimes picked up their weapons and went to war. In 0 A.D. we simulate this by having some units who can both do economical tasks (gather resources, build buildings, repair buildings) and fight. It is important to notice that advanced building can only be built by citizen soldiers.
